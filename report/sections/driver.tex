\section{Driver}
The driver is the agent responsible to bridge the high level user interface offered by CryptIC to the low level kernel operations.

It is internally organized in two interface-like modules, each implementing the core functionalities, and the top-level driver to initialize the submodules and responsible to implement the standard Linux driver facilities. The two submodules are the Cryptographic Interface Driver to integrate CryptIC with the Linux Cryptographic API, and the USB Driver to handle USB requests and communications.
